This file is just a top of mind checklist of things I need to consider for the symantec test.

- [x] Pick framework - Going to go with Spring 5 (Spring boot 2), as gives me a chance to play around with it. Also means async (FTW).
- [ ] Define API
  - [ ] Instructions say return all repo's, so no paging? Maybe a paged and unpaged API is best?
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Component tests
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Usage docs
  - [ ] Rationale of design/tech choices (keep brief)
  - [ ] JavaDocs, natch
