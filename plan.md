This file is just a top of mind checklist of things I need to consider for the Symantec test.

- [x] Pick framework - Going to go with Spring 4 using jax-rs
- [x] Define API
  - [x] Instructions say return all repo's, so no paging? Maybe a paged and unpaged API is best?
- [x] Define data model
- [x] Unit tests
- [x] Component tests
- [x] Documentation
  - [x] Usage docs
  - [x] Rationale of design/tech choices (keep brief)
