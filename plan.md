This file is just a top of mind checklist of things I need to consider for the symantec test.

- [x] Pick framework - Going to go with Spring 4 using jax-rs
- [x] Define API
  - [x] Instructions say return all repo's, so no paging? Maybe a paged and unpaged API is best?
- [x] Define data model
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Component tests
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Usage docs
  - [ ] Rationale of design/tech choices (keep brief)
  - [ ] JavaDocs, natch
